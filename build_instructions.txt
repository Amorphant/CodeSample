BUILDING:

   cd TasteTestReport
   xcodebuild -scheme TasteTestReport build

RUNNING:

The executable takes a single command line parameter, specifying the source file to be read. If no file is specified, it will attempt to read sample-input.txt from the current directory (note that after building as outlined above, this wile will be one folder back).


TESTING:

Unit tests can be run by opening the project in Xcode and hitting Cmd-U.
